#Foodhub

This is a web application built entirly using Python, Django web framework, and Postgres to help people locate a good restaurant nearby and order food to either get it deliverd or picjked up. I am using EatStreet API for getting information about the restaurant s which include the restaurant timings and menu details.

This project consists of 2 internal applications

Foodhubinit: An application that holds the user model and contains templates for landing pages and for listing restaurants

shoppingCart: As the name suggests it contains everything related to shopping cart such as adding , reoving and updating products.

Django Template is used for the front end and Bootstrap is used to beautify the web pages. 

To run the app you have to create a database in postgres / MYSQL or d3sql .I have used Postgres to address scalability issues,either Python 2.7 or 3.6 and the latestversion od Django 1.11.
